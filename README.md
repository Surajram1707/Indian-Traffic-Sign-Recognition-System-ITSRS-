Indian Traffic Sign Recognition System is a system that recognizes traffic signs on road by the use of Convolutional Neural Network that plays a vital role in the development of expert cars. From the predictions made by the system the cars will be able to take suitable decisions thereby providing the traveller a safe journey. This system makes use of already captured traffic sign images to train the model and another set of images to test the model.
